	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>Lover of Jesus</h2>
	<p>I am a lover of Jesus, a central part of my identity and someone I believe each person would do well to love by spending time reading the Bible, praying to Him, and learning about what He both did and is still doing in the world.</p>
	<h2>Curious Questioner</h2>
	<p>Learning more about the world around me and the stories of the people who live in it is one of my passions. I believe each place and person has a story to share. My desire is to ask enough questions of any topic or field that I am able to share clearly the story of what that topic or field is and how to let others understand even a part of that story themselves.</p>
	<h2>A Sensitive Soul</h2>
	<p>As someone who trusts in Jesus and believes every person matters, I am often aware that my soul is sensitive to how others are doing. I am consistently going to be willing to give hugs, say a prayer, and sit down for meals with anyone who asks. I also am sensitive to the stories I ingest and while listening to stories told in books, movies, songs, and pictures, I am completely immersed in the story until it ends. This calls for me to not stay in many stories for too long as they impact the way I see myself and the world around me. But some stories are worth staying in forever...</p>
	<h2>Believer of <em>Truth</em></h2>
	<p>Truth is often something that gets warped and sent packing in places where we don't have trust. I trust that as people learn to listen to each other, trust can be built and truth is then found. Jesus himself declared that He is the truth. If someone wants to get to know if his claim is valid, then they must learn to trust his words.</p>
	<h2>Friend of Foreigners</h2>
	<p>There are many people I count as friends in many different countries around the world. My best friends live in China, Columbia, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, France, and the USA. I myself grew up in both the USA and Kazakhstan. I have a genuine interest in seeing foreigners welcomed into peoples' homes and such. I think that there needs to be more work around the world to welcome foreigners in. As a [Third Culture Kid](https://www.tanyacrossman.com/blog/what-is-a-third-culture-kid-tck) (TCK), I feel a deep sense of belonging to those in-between worlds. More so with those who have also grown up overseas from their legal passport country, but also with those who are abroad for a time such as international students. These foreigners often become my acquaintenances and friends for life and we visit each other over the years in each others' homes.
