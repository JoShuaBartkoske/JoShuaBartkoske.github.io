Well after almost 17 years, I finally get around to building another website. I still remember using html in 2008 to create a personal website and put my link to Green Day's song "Wake Me Up When September Ends". Since that time it has only gotten easier to build a website and now with the help of [Jonathan McGlone](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) with the power of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) I can use Markdown to author my posts and keep a simple layout. So for anyone else with a heap of anxiety surrounding building your own website, I recommend using GitHub Pages and starting now.
